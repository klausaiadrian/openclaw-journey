# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Google-konto för Klaus

Klaus ska ha ett dedikerat Google-konto för:
- Skriva dokument
- Ladda upp filer
- Skicka mail

Google Drive-struktur:
```
KLAUS-LEVERANSER/
├── DAGLIGA RAPPORTER/
├── VECKORAPPORTER/
└── RESEARCH/
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
